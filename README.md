## Software Development – Task 03  
**Internship Organization:** Prodigy Infotech

### 📄 Description  
This repository contains the solution for **Task 03** of the **Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
The project focuses on building an **interactive Contact Management Application** that allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts using clean logic and a user-friendly interface.

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Design an interactive frontend using Streamlit  
- Apply logical thinking and structured programming  
- Manage user data efficiently  
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world applications  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Frontend Framework: Streamlit  
- Development Tool: Visual Studio Code / Google Colab  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

### 🚀 Features  
- Add new contacts with name and phone number  
- View all saved contacts instantly  
- Update existing contact details  
- Delete unwanted contacts  
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI

### ▶️ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PRODIGY_SD_03.git`  
2. Install required libraries  
   `pip install streamlit`  
3. Run the application  
   `streamlit run app.py`  

### 📷 Output  
Application output screenshots are available in the **screenshots** folder.

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling  
- Prevents empty contact entries  
- Ensures valid phone number input  
- Displays user-friendly error messages  
- Handles duplicate contact names safely  

### 📌 Application Workflow  
1. User enters contact details  
2. Contact is stored temporarily  
3. User can view all saved contacts  
4. Selected contacts can be edited or removed  
5. Interface updates instantly without refresh  

### 🧠 Logic Highlights  
- Uses Python lists and dictionaries for data storage  
- Streamlit session state for data persistence  
- Modular and readable code structure  
- Efficient input handling  

### 🧪 Testing  
- Tested with multiple contact entries  
- Verified update and delete operations  
- Checked UI responsiveness and validations  

### 🌐 Deployment Ready  
- Can be deployed using Streamlit Cloud  
- Compatible with Ngrok for local tunneling  
- Easily extendable with database integration  

### 📚 Learning Outcomes  
- Strong understanding of CRUD operations  
- Practical experience with Streamlit frontend  
- Improved problem-solving skills  
- Hands-on GitHub repository management  

### 🔮 Future Scope  
- Integrate database (MySQL / Firebase)  
- Add search and filter functionality  
- User authentication and login system  
- Enhanced UI design  

### 🔗 Internship Details
